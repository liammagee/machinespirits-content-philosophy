## Slide 2

### Suppose I am researching AI in Education…  

| | |
|---|---|
| As I research, I think “some **history of AI** would be good - but not too much. Maybe the first Lit Review section?”<br><br><br><br>I also notice scholars talk mainly about **learning**, **teaching** and **administration. ** And here’s a ***gap*** - people always neglect administration!<br><br> | And I notice a lot of literature speculates on the future of ed. So maybe a conclusion that reviews **future schooling**?<br><br> |

## Slide 3

### Here’s a possible **structure** for my literature review:  

| | |
|---|---|
| A History of AI in Education<br>AI and Learning<br>AI and Teaching<br>AI and Administering Pedagogy<br>Research Gap: Impact of AI on Higher Ed **Admin**<br>Schools of the Future<br><br> |  |

## Slide 4

### Now I start adding in subheadings…  

| | |
|---|---|
| A History of AI in Education<br>In the 1950s…<br>By the 1980s…<br>Then in the 2010s…<br>AI and Learning<br>Tailored Learning…<br>…But also Plagiarism<br>AI and Teaching<br>Productivity <br>Technology Fatigue (“This wasn’t the job I signed up for!”)<br><br> | 4. AI and Administering Pedagogy<br>Lowered cost of Education Delivery<br>Surveillance Schools?<br>5. Impact of AI on Higher Ed **Admin**	a. Automating procedures (communications, enrolments etc).	b. Greater efficiency, less control<br>6. Schools of the Future <br>An AI on every device<br>Ubiquitous, Life-long Learning<br>The End of Vocational Training?<br><br> |

## Slide 5

### Here’s Claude’s (sample paragraph - details not important)…  

| | |
|---|---|
| The integration of AI technologies in educational administration has shown promising potential for reducing the cost of education delivery. Several studies have explored this aspect, with varying conclusions. Smith et al. (2022) conducted a comprehensive analysis of 50 higher education institutions that implemented AI-driven administrative systems, finding an average cost reduction of 15% in operational expenses over a three-year period. This aligns with earlier predictions by Johnson (2019), who argued that AI could significantly streamline administrative processes, particularly in areas such as enrollment management and resource allocation. However, Patel and Lee (2023) caution against overestimating these cost savings, highlighting that initial implementation costs and ongoing maintenance of AI systems can be substantial. Their case study of a large public university revealed that while AI reduced certain administrative costs, these savings were partially offset by new expenditures in IT infrastructure and staff training. Despite these challenges, the consensus among researchers like Zhang et al. (2024) is that AI's potential to lower education delivery costs is significant, particularly when implemented strategically and with a long-term perspective. They emphasize that the true value of AI in reducing educational costs may lie not just in direct savings, but in its ability to enhance efficiency and free up resources for core educational activities.<br><br> |  |

## Slide 6

### But how do I **contextualise** this? What do people mean when they say “**signposting**”?  

| | |
|---|---|
| An example:<br>*[New text] ***Contrary to what scholars have argued in relation to teaching and learning, **the literature on higher education administration is generally positive.<br>*[Old text] *The integration of AI technologies in educational administration… **(blah blah)** …not just in direct savings, but in its ability to enhance efficiency and free up resources for core educational activities.<br>*[New text] *Such positive interpretations largely ignore potentially destructive effects of AI on professional staff morale, and how this in turn impacts teaching and learning outcomes. My research explores whether these effects exist, and thus **addresses a gap**. **As I show in the next section, **this gap helps to develop more realistic projections of how schools of the future may be designed to address both challenges and opportunities of AI.<br><br> |  |

## Slide 8

### Why Signpost? Show Stage Directions?  

| | |
|---|---|
| Famous AI paper: *Attention is All You Need* (Vaswani et al. 2017). Kickstarting Transformer-based models, generative AI, GPT etc<br>But also true of course for human readers – including professors<br>Part of the craft of academic writing is reminding the reader:<br>Where you’ve been <br>Where you’re going<br>If a literature review is a map, constellation, wall etc, and you are showing the reader where the **gap** is<br>You also want to show your **control** of the literature – “here’s the gap – and I know its a gap, because of what I showed you **here**, **here** and **here**”<br>Compared to your impression as an academic **writer**, you can almost never bore your reader with signposts, stage directions etc. (to a point)<br><br> |  |

## Slide 9

### Also applies more formally to Sections, Chapters, Dissertation overall  

| | |
|---|---|
| Chapter Intro: include a para that says words to the effect: “In the last chapter, I argued / showed / demonstrated **X**. In this chapter, I will do **Y**. That involve**s** covering **A**, **B** and **C**”. (X = past tense / Y = future tense)<br>Chapter Conclusion: include a para that says words to the effect: “In this chapter, I argued / showed / demonstrated **Y**. That involve**d **talking about **A**, **B** and **C**. In the next chapter, I will be looking at **Z**”.  (Y = past tense / Z = future tense)<br>Of course you rarely do things so formulaically. This is one area where Gen AI can help - “rephrase this for me: …”<br>Lack of signposting is typically for early drafts, and is the reason for many comments during review<br><br> |  |
