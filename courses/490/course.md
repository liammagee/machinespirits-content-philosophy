# Generative AI in Education

Welcome to EPOL 490: Generative AI in Education. This course explores the rapidly evolving landscape of AI in learning contexts, combining technical understanding with critical perspectives.

## Course Overview

How did we get here? And where are we going? This course examines:

- The historical development of AI and its connections to learning theory
- Technical foundations of machine learning and transformers
- Human-AI communication and prompt engineering
- Alignment, ethics, and critical perspectives on AI
- Accelerationism and visions of AI futures

## Weekly Structure

- **Week 1**: Pathways to AI - History and Foundations
- **Week 2**: How Does a Machine Learn?
- **Week 3**: How Do We Talk to AI?
- **Week 4**: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning
- **Week 5**: The Problem(s) of Alignment
- **Week 6**: Accelerate Now! Futures and Manifestos
- **Week 7-8**: Cybernetic Societies - Preparing People and Machines

## Key Questions

- What does it mean for both humans and machines to "learn"?
- How do we talk to AI, and what does "talk" mean?
- What values should we align AI to?
- What is our collective manifesto for AI in education?

## Assessment
