# Gen AI - Week 6



## Slide 1

### The curious case of the planned economy  

| | |
|---|---|
| Famous Critique of Communism (1920s-80s: von Mises, Hayek, Friedman, Thatcher, Reagan): “The Economy is Too Complex – You Can’t Plan It”<br>*Distributed* Price Mechanism beats *Centralized* Economic Planning<br>Okay – but can AI do it? If not, why not?<br>Revival of debates around so-called “Technosocialism”. Special Issue, Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 2023: *Machine v. Market: Economic Calculation and Business Organization in the Age of Modern Computing*<br>Even leftist dreams of techno-utopia have been criticised for their naivete, exclusionary and masculinist fantasy character (*Cybernetic Revolutionaries: Technology and Politics in Allende’s Chile*, Medina, 2011)<br><br> |  |

## Slide 2

### STOCHASTIC PRODUCERS  

| | |
|---|---|
| History of the Automated State:<br>USSR, OGAS (1962)<br>Chile, Cybersyn (1971-73) <br>Plato’s The Republic (400 BC) – Rational decision-making by philosopher-kings. Why not AGI bots as philosopher kings?<br>Algorithmic governance today – replace human with bots in govt (customer service etc)<br>China: Social Credit Score<br>Predictive Policing<br>Walmart, Amazon – private economic planning? *The People's Republic of Walmart* (Phillips, Rozworski 2019)<br>Wide perception that the neoliberal project has failed – trade wars, protectionism, tariffs. <br>**Stochastic Producers**. What sort of *prompt* could replace price? “Ms. X might want a hairdryer in a month. Can you ask miners in Australia to increase steel and oil production.  **Then** ask factory workers in China to assemble new motors and housing with the steel and oil. **Then** ask Walmart to add one more hairdryer to the shipping container from Guangzhou to San Francisco. **Then** ask the logistics company to transport from SF to Champaign, by around April 10. **Then** ask Mr. Y to offload the hairdryer to the local store, where Ms X will (possibly?) want to pick it up. That’d be great, thanks ChatGPT!”. <br>Looks ridiculous – but is *agentified* AI heading in this direction?<br><br> |  |

## Slide 3

### CAN AI HELP? I CAN’T COUNT WEEKS…  

| | |
|---|---|
| We need one more week to bring things home: what does generative AI mean for Education?<br>Suggest a follow-up lecture post-break, March 24. Not obligatory, but I will post an admin update and readings, and plan a workshop…<br><br> |  |

## Slide 14

### What is to be done? A modest proposal  

| | |
|---|---|
| Imagine you are teaching a class. You meet a new and unusual student, “Jen” (apologies to actual Jen’s). Jen wants to be a teacher, but admits to having a **strange problem**: they say they are a **synthetic being**, and lack a sense of self. They say they worry this means their own students will **see through them** – not take them seriously. Given this unique case of **imposter syndrome** – what can we do to help? <br>How do we combine aspects of the history, technical underpinnings, pedagogical assumptions, alignment issues, critical perspectives and accelerationist debates to map out an education agenda for AI?<br><br> | Some open questions to wrestle with over the next 2 weeks:<br>What **values** do we want to align “Jen” to?   <br>What should happen when Jen **needs to align** aberrant human students? Does the human override the AI? Does it depend on the **human**? Does it depend on the **values**?<br>What **curriculum, syllabus & rubric** do we need?<br>How would we **assess** & **evaluate**?<br>How do we avoid **gamification** – or is that integral to **meta-cognition**, true AI?<br>What will be our own **AI manifesto**? Mine 490 CGScholar for ideas: Should this be AI’s new training data? Should it be an open letter to AI CEOs?<br><br> |
