## Slide 3

### What’s so bad about technology?  

| | |
|---|---|
| Stochastic Parrots peck away at the deeper impulses behind AI:<br>Feminist critique of white male fantasies of *speed* (think of Marinetti), *size* (large language models), *scale*<br>Gebru, Torres (2024): *The TESCREAL Bundle: Eugenics and the Promise of Utopia through Artificial General Intelligence*<br>Interconnections between eugenics, longtermism, effective altruism, pursuit of AGI, accelerationism – a coherent ideology?<br>Technology (*pace* Aaron) associated with *techne*: skill, craft, practice<br>Contrasted with *episteme*, theoretical knowledge (Aristotle)<br>Contrasted with *poesis*: closer to manifesting, bringing forth, revealing (Heidegger)<br>*Techne* is the non-theoretical, non-poetic: the messy making of things<br>Contemporary stereotypes: the artist vs the *technician*; the abstract thinker or strategist vs the person concerned with *technique*<br>Does Silicon Valley still struggle with an inferiority complex?<br>It is not **academic** (technical knowledge is shallow, ephemeral – no episteme)<br>It is not **artistic** (technicians cannot be cool – no poeisis)  <br>Techbros go cultural: Gates’ infamous dance, Zuckerberg’s “glow up”, Musk’s SNL appearance, the Silicon Valley “philosophers” (Thiel, Schmidt, Andreesen, Karp, Friedman)<br><br> |  |

## Slide 4

### Why so defensive?   “Polite society” – artists, academics – value slow, deep, sustained, patient, non-egoic, social Something crass, desperate, antisocial about the technical sphere – unfeeling, mechanical, not really connected to *meaning* (Bender et al.) Technology retains this sense of *gendered* **immaturity**: “boys’ toys”, restlessness, tinkering, uncritical optimism, inflated dramatism (end-of-the-world + save-the-world rhetoric), *hubristic* movements (transhumanism, singularitarianism, effective altruism – Gebru & Torres 2024).  Shift from parody, ridicule to alarmism, fear, critique, activism But also, genuine: What can actually be done? Once power is embedded in technological infrastructure, it is hard to dislodge. The Black Box Society (Pasquale 2015); The Automatic Society (Stiegler 2016); algocracy / algorithmic governance (Aneesh 2006; Issar & Aneesh 2021); Automating Inequality (Eubanks 2018); Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff 2014) point to these problems. Do we even know why algorithms make the decisions they do? AI:  Continuation of this fantasy, a sort of *neo-colonization or territorialization* (Deleuze & Guattari) of **interior **and** exterior worlds** The illusion of *control and mastery*, at the micro-level of individual cognition: the banishing of forgetfulness, dyslexia, malapropisms, reasoning failures, class, gendered or racialized linguistic *registers*. AI helps us write & talk properly; it **normalizes** aberrant discourse. We can all be academics now? *Commodity* *fetishism* (in the Marxian sense): the social relations between people (everyday communication, art etc) are turned into the ultimate product – the thing that *generates*, *engenders*, a machine of endless (and relentless) cultural production – we marvel at the technology, not the human history of art that makes the technology possible **Revenge of the Nerds**: *Techne* becomes both *episteme* and *poesis.* No longer opposed, techne is now *meta-technology*. “Let’s have those arrogant scholars and artists come to us”.

|---|---|
| Extreme: racist, sexist, proto-fascist. Marinetti a friend and supporter of Mussolini in the 1910s<br>Celebrates youth, speed, breaks with the past (leads to concern about fascism’s reactionary tendencies). Desire for violence. Technology is not computation; it is fast cars, streetcars, trains<br>Later echoes? Punk? Grunge? Techno? Anarchism? Other subcultures<br>Blends hedonism, nihilism, violence, speed. Coincidentally the rise of psychoanalysis and theorisation of the Pleasure Principle and the Death Instinct (1920). <br>Post-war echoes: Benedek’s *The Wild One* (1953). Goddard’s *Un Bout de Souffle* (1960), J.G. Ballard’s *Crash* (1973), Saura’s *Deprisa Deprisa* (1981)<br>“Standing on the world's summit we launch once again our insolent challenge to the stars!” – think of the role of rockets and Mars in contemporary futurist fantasies<br><br> | ![Image](images/gen_ai___week_6_img_3.png)<br><br><br><br>![Image](images/gen_ai___week_6_img_4.png)<br><br> |

### #ACCELERATE, TO THE LEFT AND TO THE RIGHT  

| | |
|---|---|
| **Left Accelerationist Tendencies:**<br>Accelerate Capitalism until it *Collapses* upon Itself<br>Fixed Capital / Dead is a *Social Product*, Shared Inhertance (Marx)<br>*Fully Automated Luxury Communism* (Bastani, Williams, Srnicek)<br>Break free of Oppressive Identities – Make Your Own through Technology (Haraway’s Cyborg)<br>Better, Scientific Breakthroughs (Amodei)<br>Universal Basic Income?!<br><br> | **Right Accelerationist Tendencies:**<br>The World is *Agonistic*, Zero Sum Game (Peter Thiel, via Carl Schmitt (1930s)) <br>Accelerate Capitalism Forever (Trickle-down Economics; All Boats Rise)<br>Reward Innovation – Aim to Monopolise<br>Also Regressive: Protect Traditional Identities (Thiel’s Christianity)<br>Better, Scientific Breakthroughs (Amodei)<br>Universal Basic Income?!<br><br> |

## Slide 8

### The cyborgian process of production  

| | |
|---|---|
| For Marx (in this celebrated “Fragment on Machines” at any rate), we get a cyborgian image of labour – the machine at its centre, human workers merely appendages<br>But, once adopted into the production process of capital, the means of labour passes through different metamorphoses, whose **culmination is the machine**, or rather, an automatic system of machinery (system of machinery: the automatic one is merely its most complete, most adequate form, and alone transforms machinery into a system), set in motion by an **automaton, a moving power that moves itself**; this automaton consisting of **numerous mechanical and intellectual organs**, so that the workers themselves are cast merely as its **conscious linkages**.<br><br> |  |

## Slide 9

### A future without work?  

| | |
|---|---|
| “Capital itself is the moving **contradiction**, [in] that it presses to **reduce labour time to a minimum**, while it posits labour time, on the other side, as **sole measure **and** source of wealth**.”<br>“What capital adds is that it increases the **surplus labour time of the mass** by all the means of **art and science**, because its wealth consists directly in the appropriation of surplus labour time; since value directly its purpose, not use value. It is thus, **despite itself**, instrumental in creating the means of **social disposable time**, in order to reduce labour time for the whole society to a diminishing minimum, and thus to **free everyone’s time for their own development**.” <br>Marx imagines here the acceleration of capitalism:<br>Capitalism wants profit, and therefore to create as much “surplus labour time” as possible. More surplus labour = more surplus value = more profit<br>So it develops technology (“art and science”) to exploit workers more<br>**But **this really means capitalism means the necessities of life are made more efficiently<br>Eventually (?) this surplus becomes “social disposable time” which can be employed – not for the capitalists’ profit – but for “their own development” (i.e. whatever you want) <br>Marx’ **accelerationist paradox**: factory machinery exploits labour, but also creates the conditions for eventual emancipation and utopia<br>Also important: Marx sees machinery as involving social (not individual) production. <br>Dead labour / fixed capital is *durable*. It is, if we like, the gift of preceding generations to our own: techniques and material that enable us to live with **less** “circulating” labour. We don’t need to work as hard to survive.<br>Moreover we become new kinds of subjects: “Free time – which is both idle time and time for higher activity – has naturally transformed its possessor into a different subject, and he then enters into the direct production process as this different subject.”<br>This is not the Marx we grew up with: he wants a future without work, focussed on **human development and growth**…<br><br> |  |

## Slide 10

### #Accelerate into history?  

| | |
|---|---|
| Williams & Scnicek: what if this accelerationist Marx was right? Accelerate to deliver universal luxury (Bastani: Fully Automated Luxury Communism)<br>Thiel: Essentially an agonistic view of geopolitics. Technology & AI become tools to protect national interest (invests in Palantir, Anduril). Accelerate<br><br> |  |
