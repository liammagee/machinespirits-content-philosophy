      This simulation models social dynamics inspired by Hegelian philosophy.
      Switch between different scenarios to observe how recognition, alienation,
      and emergence manifest in agent behavior. Record your observations and
      reflect on how these abstract concepts translate to observable patterns.

# Lecture 4: Social Simulation Activity

This lecture demonstrates the new **Simulation** activity type, which allows students to explore philosophical and social concepts through interactive agent-based simulations.

## Simulation Activities

Simulations provide experiential learning through:

- **Multiple scenarios**: Recognition, Alienation, Reification, Dialectic, Emergence
- **Adjustable parameters**: Rigidity, Social Drive, Chaos
- **Observation recording**: Document patterns and insights
- **Conceptual frameworks**: Connect simulations to philosophical theory
- **Guided reflection**: Synthesize observations into understanding

### Available Scenarios

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Recognition** | Agents seek each other, forming connections through mutual acknowledgment |
| **Alienation** | Agents repel, becoming isolated fragments |
| **Reification** | Agents move in rigid, mechanical patterns - living becoming thing-like |
| **Dialectic** | Opposing forces create synthesis through contradiction |
| **Emergence** | Complex collective behavior arises from simple individual rules |
| **Custom** | Define your own parameters to explore |

### Hegelian Connections

These simulations are inspired by concepts from Hegel's *Phenomenology of Spirit*:

- **Recognition**: The master-bondsman dialectic and mutual acknowledgment
- **Alienation**: The experience of being cut off from one's social nature
- **Reification**: The reduction of living subjects to mere objects
- **Dialectic**: The movement of thesis-antithesis-synthesis

## Try It Out

1. Start with the Recognition scenario
2. Observe how agents seek each other out
3. Switch to Alienation - note the difference
4. Try adjusting parameters to see their effects
5. Record at least 3 observations per activity
6. Write a reflection connecting observations to theory

## Learning Objectives

By completing these simulations, you should be able to:
- Visualize abstract philosophical concepts
- Understand how simple rules create emergent behavior
- Connect theoretical frameworks to observable dynamics
- Reflect on how these patterns appear in real social life
