## Slide 2

### Case study: How do EFL university teachers deal with the heterogeneous classroom?  

| | |
|---|---|
| “The present case study aims to investigate the **strategies** that **Kazakhstani university English language teachers** use to cope with **heterogeneous students in their classroom**. <br>To this end, **two university English teachers** in one of the higher institutions in Kazakhstan were **observed** during their teaching sessions and **interviewed** in order to **identify the reasons why** they used particular **teaching strategies** to deal with **heterogeneous students**. “<br>We are dealing with *two interview transcripts*. <br>Can also imagine some initial codes: **strategies**; **heterogenous students**; **reasons**. Maybe also: **classroom**.<br><br> |  |

## Slide 4

### Keep a **separate secure Excel file**, with codes and names **Rename files** with codes, using a consistent file name convention **Rename** participant in the transcript: “Aizere” > “Participant A” Use *Microsoft Word*’s **Protect Document** feature to remove names from properties Take care with **identifying details**   FIRST, ENSURE CONFIDENTIALITY

## Slide 6

### Braun & Clarke (2006) - from week 2  

| | |
|---|---|
| familiarising yourself with your data<br>Search for ‘latent or semantic themes’<br>‘Take notes’ or mark ‘ideas for coding’<br>‘Transcribing verbal data’<br>generating initial codes<br>‘writing notes’, highlighting text (different colours = different themes / codes)<br>searching for themes<br>Analyse codes<br>Tables, mind-maps, ‘theme piles’<br>reviewing themes<br>Develop & refine candidate themes<br>Data within one theme should be ‘homogenous’; data from different themes should be ‘heterogenous’<br>Refine (i) by document and (ii) across the whole corpus<br>defining and naming themes<br>producing the report<br><br> |  |

## Slide 7

### Steps 1, 2 – Sample THEMES & codes  

| | |
|---|---|
| ![Image](images/bolashak___week_6___caqdas_with_dedoose_img_8.png)<br><br> | **Some key terms?**<br>“Difficult”<br>“Lesson plan”<br>“Bored”, “Distracted”, “Know everything”<br>“Challenge”<br><br><br><br>Draft** Themes **and *Codes*<br>**Lesson plan**<br>**Task Difficulty **<br>*Common*<br>*Difficult / Challenging*<br>**Student State**<br>*Arrogance*<br>*Boredom*<br>*Distraction*<br><br> |

## Slide 8

### Try codes with chatgpt, deepseek  

| | |
|---|---|
| Can codes be extracted? We can test this out…<br><br> |  |

---

## Slide 9

### Choosing a qda product  

| | |
|---|---|
| **Commercial** vs **Open Source**?<br>**Manual** vs **Automated Coding**?<br>**Dedicated Tool** vs **General-purpose Product**?<br>QDA (Qualitative Data Analysis) is a **niche** product – not used outside of academia (though has applications in marketing – see DoveTail)<br>See Week 3 – encourage use of AI, but with **human checking**<br><br> | Also: remember **why** we want to do coding. Many studies assume the following is acceptable as a methodology:<br>	“We apply thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke 2006) to transcripts of interviews / focus groups”<br>But **why**? When will other approaches work:<br>Read & highlight the text for **meaningful** responses to questions<br>Word frequency analysis / word clouds / other NLPs techniques (using Python & ChatGPT - week 3)<br><br> |

---

## Slide 10

### Thematic analysis – pause  

| | |
|---|---|
| Sometimes “coding” is a fancy way to **lose** meaning in your data. Make sure you know **why** thematic analysis is right<br>If data is **small **(1-2 interviews) – maybe simply read & comment?<br>If data is **large **(100s+ of documents) – will thematic analysis scale? Need algorithmic support, alternate techniques<br>Common arguments about “how many” interviews / surveys – determined by *technology* & *research time* – not necessarily epistemological concerns (validity, reliability)<br><br> |  |

## Slide 16

### ![Image](images/bolashak___week_6___caqdas_with_dedoose_img_14.png)   Open source / free?  

| | |
|---|---|
| Not really? <br>Products like *QualCoder*, *Taguette* - no experience with them, but seem individual hobby projects<br>Would encourage trying them out<br>Require more technical expertise? Less fully featured?<br>Not like quant data analysis: R, Python both hugely popular, supported, etc<br>AI: definitely an option (see Week 3). Many QDA products include an “AI” option at additional cost (likely a “wrapper” around ChatGPT / Claude).<br><br> | ![Image](images/bolashak___week_6___caqdas_with_dedoose_img_15.png)<br><br> |

---

## Slide 17

### Microsoft word?  

| | |
|---|---|
| Fine for small projects<br>Requires discipline in colour coding / highlighting<br>Hard to extract metrics: common themes / codes<br>Not good for collaboration: hard to check **inter-rater reliability** (do Raigul and Aigerim code data in the same way?)<br><br> | ![Image](images/bolashak___week_6___caqdas_with_dedoose_img_16.png)<br><br> |

## Slide 18

### dedoose OVERVIEW  

| | |
|---|---|
| Benefits: Cheap, simple, collaborative<br>Data is based in the **cloud** – not as private as desktop-based<br>**NOT **an endorsement. <br>All QDA software is quite complex, buggy… Not an area of “high” quality software – 1990/2000s era with incremental updates. <br>Expect to spend time re-doing some steps, backing up data, learning tutorials…<br><br> | Very quick overview – for more information:<br>Download: <br>https://www.dedoose.com/resources/articledetail/dedoose-desktop-app <br>Lots of videos, tutorials etc: <br>https://helpdesk.dedoose.com/hc/en-us<br>https://www.dedoose.com/home/resources <br><br>Explore the Demo Project…<br><br> |

|---|---|
| 7. Add codes: strategies; heterogenous students; reasons; classroom<br>8. You have two key concepts:<br>**Codes**<br>**Media** (documents)<br>9. Your job is then to **open media**, **apply codes, add descriptors / fields **and then **analyze**<br><br><br><br>![Image](images/bolashak___week_6___caqdas_with_dedoose_img_22.png)<br><br> |  |

## Slide 22

### What if you need to classify?   ![Image](images/bolashak___week_6___caqdas_with_dedoose_img_23.png)  

| | |
|---|---|
|  | Interviews by age, gender, other variables<br>Dedoose has concept of descriptors / fields / sets<br>You might want to test:<br>Does the code “strategies” appear more often among women than men participants?<br><br> |

---

## Slide 23

### In this example I have said Participant A is a woman, Participant B is a man (both are I think women in reality?) And there **is** a difference: participant B focuses more on **difficulties**, A on **strategies** So we could see how we begin to develop a picture of the data…

## Slide 24

### Next steps?  

| | |
|---|---|
| More codes, sub-codes: Different **kinds** of strategies, difficulties<br>**More** fields (primary language – Kazakh, Russian?; age; urban / rural; school level, etc)<br>Add **memos** – reasons or comments about assignment of **codes** to **media** (**excerpts**) – can help with analysis<br>Explore different **analytic** combinations <br>Collaboration – examine **inter-rater reliability**<br>**Mixed** methods – multimedia, quantitative data etc<br><br> |  |

## Slide 25

### Next steps?  

| | |
|---|---|
| Convert into textual commentary in a journal article. Examples:<br>High level **summary**: “After coding the interview transcripts, we found teachers used a variety of strategies – pairing students, being more permissive of weaker students making errors, offering token rewards (e.g. chocolate bars), challenging high performing students, offering praise – and even singing songs!”<br>Include **excerpts as quotes**: “One participant (B) stated that pairing was helpful: ‘*Then, somehow, these strong students they help weaker students.*’” <br>Add** detailed analysis**: “Teachers with varied strategies – such as participant B – rarely spoke of difficulties, suggesting that having a repertoire of such strategies was important in managing classrooms with heterogenous students”.<br>Examine **differences**, possible **causes**, and potential **solutions**: “**[DIFFERENCE]** Curiously, female teachers seemed to have more strategies for managing heterogenous classrooms than male. **[CAUSE]** This may be due to male teachers being focussed on elevating higher performing students, and suggests **[SOLUTION] **more effort needs to be spent on training teachers to focus on overall classroom performance.”<br><br> |  |
