### The ‘loop’ of a research article: from ignorance to knowledge  

| | |
|---|---|
| **Introduction**:<br>**Asks** a research question<br>Can say why the research question responds to a **problem**<br>Often opens up a **wide** and **complete** space of research<br><br><br><br>**Analysis / Discussion / Conclusion**:<br>**Answers** the research question<br>Can say why the answer forms part of a **solution**<br>Can say why the answer is **narrow** and **partial:** <br>includes **contribution** to the literature<br>but also **limitations** and **further work**<br><br> |  |

## Slide 7

### Discussion / Conclusion  

| | |
|---|---|
| In other words, use these sections **strategically:**<br>Reflect on questions of:<br>**Validity** (put simply: are your results true / robust)<br>**Reliability** (can your results be generalized - and how?)<br>IF “My sample is 10 Year 8 students at a high school in Almaty”<br>THEN Can my results be extended to **all:**<br>**“**Year 8 students *at the same high school* in Almaty”<br>**“**Students (at any level) *at the same high school *in Almaty”<br>**“**Year 8 students at any high school in Almaty”<br>**“**Year 8 students at any high school” (in Kazakhstan / the world)<br>Etc etc<br>Discuss **limitations **and scope for **further work**<br>Consider practical **implications **and the **meaning** of the research<br>Remind the reader / review of the **contribution** of the article to the literature - what gap it fills and why this matters<br>Preempt, integrate and respond to **criticism explicitly**: “while this research does not address all concerns about AI in the classroom, it does…”<br><br> |  |
