### ![Image](images/bolashak___week_5___cyber_social_research_img_1.png)   History of knowledge production  

| | |
|---|---|
| Knowledge is **Heroic, Promethean**<br>**Solipsistic**<br>Marked by idea of **Genius **(divine spirit)<br> Many **stereotypes**: Descartes, Goethe, Darwin, Pasteur, Nietzsche<br>**Knowledge** is the product of **Romantic** (and **Tragic**) **Vision**<br>**Culminates** in late 19th / early 20th century: Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Ramanujan, Einstein, Gödel, Turing, Benjamin<br><br><br><br>**Midjourney, “Dr Frankenstein in his laboratory, style of Matisse --ar 9:16”**<br><br> |  |

### ![Image](images/bolashak___week_5___cyber_social_research_img_2.png)   knowledge industrializes….   Knowledge becomes **institutional:** **Universities, Colleges, Departments, Institutes, Schools** **Systematic Literature Review (1970s…) ****– **note the keyword “system” Emphasis on **Reproducible **Knowledge (in all disciplines) Re-thinking “knowledge” itself as **structural **(influence of “hermeneutics of suspicion”: Marx, Nietzsche, Freud) World of **grants**, **peer review**, **computerized** analysis, education at **SCALE** Knowledge is **manufactured**, and is a product **for** industry Primacy of the **Journal Article**

## Slide 5

### the Author AS producer (BENJAMIN, 1934)  

| | |
|---|---|
| “Literary competence is no longer based on specialized training in academic schools, but on technical and commercial training in trade schools and thus becomes **common property**.”<br>“in politics it is not individual thoughts, but, as Brecht once expressed it, the **art of thinking what is in the heads of other people**, that is decisive”<br>“the **place of the intellectual in the class struggle** can only be determined, or better, chosen, on the **basis of his position in the process of production**”<br>“The determinant factor is the exemplary character of a production that enables it, first, to **lead other producers to this production**, and secondly to present them with an improved apparatus for their use. And this apparatus is better to the degree that it leads consumers to production, in short that it is capable of making **co-workers out of readers or spectators**. We already possess such a model, about which I can only speak briefly here. That is Brecht’s epic theatre.”<br><br> | **Common Elements**<br>Focus on *Technique*: writing (and knowledge) become regarded as similar to a craft, occupation, trade, industry<br>Knowledge as being “common property”<br>A *social* process (“heads of other people”)<br>Knowledge involves *means of production*: materiality, technology (this aspect of Benjamin remains current nearly a century later)<br>“Co-workers”: knowledge as proces of co-production, collaboration<br><br> |

### Writing with “And others”  

| | |
|---|---|
| *et al*. = et alia<br>(“and others”)<br>More and more knowledge is made by X “**and others**”<br>**Who** are these “others”? What do they **do**? How is knowledge **diversified**?<br><br><br><br>**Common Activities or Roles:**<br>Literature Review<br>Data Collection<br>IRB<br>Research Project Management<br>Academic Writing<br>Overall Article Framing (Intro & Conclusion)<br>Professorial Prestige?<br>…<br><br> |  |

## Slide 12

### Politics of collaboration  

| | |
|---|---|
| Author Order<br>Who is In? Who is Out?<br>Do all co-named contribute equally?<br>For multiple publications: Rotational Order?<br>“Obligatory” Co-authorship for Professors?<br>Promote Junior Colleagues?<br>Differences in tone / style / position<br>Often co-authored articles **take longer to write** – no shortcut<br><br> |  |

## Slide 13

### Cyber-social ???  

| | |
|---|---|
| AI: Not (yet) properly collaborative<br>Conversations are **one-to-one** (human-to-AI), not many-to-one (humans-to-AI)<br>Chat conversations can be **shared **(but not **extended**)<br>But it is **coming**…<br>And what do we do about **co-authorship with bots**?<br>https://discord.com/channels/1288548492691898430/1346607963338702989<br><br> |  |

| | |
|---|---|
| Post-industrial knowledge: artisanal, hipster…<br>“Agile” – keyword from software culture<br>Derives from 1980s Toyota / Japanese approach to industrial production<br>Managing chaos, changing requirements – suitable for academia?<br>**Networked** instead of hierarchical – peer-review (and now AI review)<br>Melds with contemporary language of “participation”, “diversity”, “inclusion”<br>Think of Cybersyn (1971-73)<br><br> |  |
