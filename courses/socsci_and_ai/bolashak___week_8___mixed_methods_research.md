| | |
|---|---|
| Many reasons:<br>*Triangulate* quantitative with qualitative data – *confirm* (or deny) hypotheses – address some issues of bias<br>Interviews / focus group discussions can *enrich* survey results, adding depth to what are otherwise numbers<br>Provide *causal* explanations: why do numbers appear the way they do?<br>Surveys can *substantiate* interviews, which often involve small sample sizes<br>Appeal to *sceptics*: some people distrust numbers; some people distrust words; why not both?<br><br> | Offer more contrast: sometimes survey questions disguise as much as they reveal<br>“20% of students use AI” – yes, but 10% might be high achievers; 10% might be low achievers. Interviews can **unpack** summarized survey data<br><br> |
