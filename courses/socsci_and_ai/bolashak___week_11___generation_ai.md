## Slide 2

### MANY RESPONSES  

| | |
|---|---|
| What AI cannot (yet) do:<br>**Mix** of cognitive, physical and social tasks (so-called “trades”: plumbing, cooking, nursing, care, gardening)<br>These tasks that don’t “automate” easily – always many minute & simple decisions that combine mind, body and an understanding of others<br>Show **curiosity**: explore & understand the world (AI does not have desire)<br>More abstractly: Activities that involve genuine orientation towards **time**, **temporality**, **mortality**, **finitude**<br><br> | What we do not want AI to do:<br>Counselling, friendship, love, empathy<br>These involve pleasure, because another **recognizes** us (Hegel, Honneth)<br>If we are not recognized by this **other** which is like **us**, then it may not matter how well that other pretends to be like us<br>(and yet AI romance, therapy, friendship is booming)<br>Leadership<br>Leadership involves **accountability** - taking responsibility for mistakes etc. Not simply rationality<br><br> |

Will be very hard to dislodge<br>Education – with but also beyond AI – is central to producing adults, citizens, workers who<br><br> |
