|---|---|
| An Introduction, with notes on AI<br><br> |  |

## Slide 2

### Qualia / Qualities  

| | |
|---|---|
| What is “qualitative research”?<br>Intuitively: Study of words not numbers<br>People who prefer humanities (interpretation) to science (analysis)<br>Listening / Reading over Counting<br>Open over Closed questions<br>More formally: hold a critique towards Comtean positivism: <br>Sociology is not the next in a sequence of sciences (physics > chemistry > biology > psychology > sociology)<br>It is instead differs from other sciences by *kind*, not just *degree*. The social and the natural sciences involve radically different epistemologies.<br><br> |  |

## Slide 3

### But these distinctions are complex  

| | |
|---|---|
| **All ***qualities* involve at least implicit *quantification*<br>“Participant X was *highly* critical of…”<br>“Members of the focus group agreed the policies were *hard to understand*”<br><br>And **all** quantitative research involves some kind of initial *qualitative* distinction:<br>Time / age<br>Gender<br>Attitudes / behaviors / knowledge<br><br>The “binary” distinction between qualitative and quantitative research should be treated with caution. <br>Hence also: rise of *mixed methods* of research.<br><br> |  |

## Slide 4

### Background…  

| | |
|---|---|
| Qualitative research and the History of Hermenuetics (a science (*Wissenshaft*) of interpretation) (Hermes: the Messenger God)<br>Closely connected to German tradition of phenomenology<br>This history can get lost in the mechanical application of computer tools to interpretation (CAQDAS - Computer-Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Systems)<br>Perversely AI might be leading back to hermeneutics…<br><br> |  |

|---|---|
| **Interpretation** of the **Part**<br><br> |  |

## Slide 6

### ![Image](images/bolashak___week_2___qualitative_research_img_2.png)   Example  

| | |
|---|---|
| My research question: “How are middle-school students using AI in the classroom?”<br>I draw upon my experience as a teacher… (one part)<br>I read a newspaper article… (another part)<br>I surmise students are **plagiarising **(the whole)<br>But then I read some papers (more parts)<br>And interview some students (more parts)<br>And realise students use AI in complex ways (to increase their knowledge, to test their homework, to brainstorm… and yes, sometimes to cheat) (the whole, **revised**)<br>This is at least what we hope (for research, education, knowledge)... an expansion or enrichment of the *whole*, through the careful accumulation and interpretation of *parts*<br><br> |  |

---

## Slide 7

### The Problem of Subjectivity  

| | |
|---|---|
| Whose Interpretation is Right? Especially in an era of scientific method<br>Strategies:<br>*Ignore* Interpretation – Scientific Method (and apply it to the social sciences: Comte, 1840s)<br>*Elevate* Interpretation – “Beyond” Physics (Metaphysics; perhaps Hegelian idealism the greatest example)<br>*Develop* Interpretation as counter-science / criticism. “Hermeneutics of Suspicion” (Paul Ricoeur:<br>Marx: Criticism can unveil *Ideology* – the mask that hides material relations under high-minded (but bourgois) ideas of humanity, truth etc.<br>Nietzsche: Criticism can show how all claims – especially moral claims – disguise an underlying *Will to Power*<br>Freud: Interpretation can show how *desire *helps to manufacture human thought, speech, action in everyday life (dreams, jokes, paraphraxes, unwanted thoughts, pathology)<br><br> |  |

## Slide 8

### 21st Century Social Sciences (incl. Education)  

| | |
|---|---|
| Still struggle with these dilemmas. How do we argue about topics that cannot be *proven*? <br>One response: reliable and valid qualitative research<br>After all, we cannot all be Marx, Nietzche, Freud<br>We need “everyday” methods of argumentation<br>Aims to elevate techniques of interpretation to (quasi-)science<br>Collate *data* (text, other media):<br>From interviews, focus group discussions, ethnography, observation (obtrusive research)<br>Or from documents, data, archives, collections (unobtrusive research)<br>Develop *themes* (either pre- or post-analysis (grounded theory approaches))<br>Use themes to organize *codes*<br>Apply *codes* to *data*<br>Analyze coded data: *what* codes and themes appear most often? *Where* do they appear? Are there *differences* within or between participants or documents?<br><br> |  |

---

## Slide 9

### Many approaches, both technical and epistemological  

| | |
|---|---|
| Approaches:<br>Discourse Analysis / Critical Discourse Analysis (DA/CDA)<br>Narrative Analysis<br>Content Analysis (more technical)<br>Media Analysis<br>Conversational Analysis<br>Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis<br>Thematic Analysis – article(s) by Braun & Clarke (2006)<br>Techniques:<br>Informal “coding”: analogue, by hand, post-it notes, note-taking<br>CAQDAS software: similar, but keeps systematic track of highlighted sections<br>Pair-coding: triangulation<br><br> |  |

---

## Slide 10

### Theory-first or Data-first?  

| | |
|---|---|
| Theory-driven<br>Themes are ‘pre-given’ – usually via literature / taxonomy / ontology<br>For example: Bloom’s Taxonomy<br>Create<br>Evaluate<br>Analyze<br>Apply<br>Understand<br>Remember<br>Develop “codebook” from themes - usually many more than themes<br>For each document in corpus:<br>Apply codes<br>Data-driven / grounded theory<br>Read corpus<br>Identify emergent themes, codes<br>For each document in corpus:<br>Begin coding<br>Revise themes, codes<br>Iterate through corpus<br><br> |  |

---

## Slide 11

### Braun & Clarke’s (2006) Influential Guide  

| | |
|---|---|
| familiarising yourself with your data<br>Search for ‘latent or semantic themes’<br>‘Take notes’ or mark ‘ideas for coding’<br>‘Transcribing verbal data’<br>generating initial codes<br>‘writing notes’, highlighting text (different colours = different themes / codes)<br>searching for themes<br>Analyse codes<br>Tables, mind-maps, ‘theme piles’<br>reviewing themes<br>Develop & refine candidate themes<br>Data within one theme should be ‘homogenous’; data from different themes should be ‘heterogenous’<br>Refine (i) by document and (ii) across the whole corpus<br>defining and naming themes<br>producing the report<br><br> |  |

---

## Slide 12

### Coding  

| | |
|---|---|
| Theme / sub-theme vs ‘code’: themes usually higher level / fewer in number<br>How many themes / codes? <br>Too few leaves gaps in analysis; too many creates complexity<br>How should they be organised (*flat*, or *shallow hierarchy*)?<br>Are the codes a *logical* system (mutually exclusive) or simply descriptive?<br>Do the codes *make sense* to other researchers? (See Zhu’s work on social annotation)<br>What is the relationship of *themes* to *codes*? <br>Typically, one to many - maybe 3-6 themes; 10-30 codes?<br><br> | ![Image](images/bolashak___week_2___qualitative_research_img_3.png)<br><br> |

## Slide 15

### Why AI?  

| | |
|---|---|
| Some cautions: <br>thematic analysis is **supposed to be** time-consuming<br>‘Quick’ or automated interpretations – even with advanced AI – ignore **important nuances** that come from local & contextual knowledge, embeddedness, understanding human speech (and body language), tonality, possible underlying motivations<br>Can AI ever be truly **suspicious**?<br>On the other hand: AI is often **biased**<br>However:<br>in practice, interpretation is often under **time & budget constraints**: analyze data, produce a report, deliver recommendations<br>in the digital age, qualitative data sets are often **huge** – meaning qualitative sampling is likely to be very biased, non-representative<br>**team-based coding often** infeasible<br>automation can help **triangulate human interpretation** (including human **bias**)<br><br> |  |
